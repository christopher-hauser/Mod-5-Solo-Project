# Rarebnb

## Summary
Rarebnb is a booking application inspired by Airbnb using Javascript utilizing React/Redux architecture. Rarebnb allows users to:
- Create an account
- Log in and log out
- Browse available spots (whether they are logged in or out)
- Host, update, and take down their own spots
- Book available spots and cancel those bookings
- View their bookings

## Overall Structure
### Back end
Rarebnb was built using Javascript and a postgreSQL database. All data requests use AJAX and are fulfilled with a JSON API, utilizing RESTful routes. 

## Front end
Rarebnb's front end is built entirely with React.js and JavaScript. This allows for quick rendering and re-rendering as pages dynamically update with the information retrieved from the Redux store.

## Libraries
- React.js
- Redux
